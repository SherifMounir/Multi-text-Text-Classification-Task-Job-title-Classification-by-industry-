# Multi-text-Text-Classification-Task-Job-title-Classification-by-industry-
Given a dataset that has two variables (Job title &amp; Industry) in a csv format of more than 8,500 samples. This dataset is imbalanced (Imbalance means that the number of data points available for different classes is different). I'll build a model using any Machine Learning classifier algorithm to classify job titles by the industry and provide you with insights on how the model works.
# Preprocessing
  * Cleaning the Dataset .
  * Undersampling for Handling Imbalanced Dataset 
# Create Fecture Vector
# Train Data using SVM (Linear Support Vector Machine)
# Evaluate the Model
